# CodingChallengeProject13
This repository will hold 3 folders, each folder has a single file
containing a problem from the following the websites. LeetCode, Hackerrank, Codewars.

Each of the 3 files will contain not only the original problem  from that website,
but also a solved version with my thought process on how I went about solving that problem.
